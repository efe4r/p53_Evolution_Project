## Overview
This project investigates the evolutionary conservation, functional hotspots, and structural features of the p53 tumor suppressor protein. The analysis includes:

- Conservation analysis across species
- Identification of mutational hotspots and functional domains
- Phylogenetic tree construction
- 3D structural visualization (static PNG)

## Contents
- Python scripts for figure generation
- PyMOL scripts for 3D visualization
- PDF report with all figures and tables
- Large datasets (PNG, PDB) tracked with Git LFS
